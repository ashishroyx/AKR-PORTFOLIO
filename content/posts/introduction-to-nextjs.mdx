Next.js is known for its powerful support for **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** â€” a technique that generates HTML for a page on each request.

## What is Server-Side Rendering?

In SSR, your page is rendered on the server at request time, then sent as fully-rendered HTML to the browser. This is different from Client-Side Rendering (CSR), where the browser builds the page after downloading JavaScript.

SSR improves:

- **Performance** on slower devices
- **SEO** since search engines can crawl rendered content
- **First Page Load Speed** especially for dynamic content

## How to Use SSR in Next.js

Next.js allows you to opt into SSR at the page level using the `getServerSideProps` function.

```tsx
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const data = await res.json()

  return {
    props: {
      data
    }
  }
}
