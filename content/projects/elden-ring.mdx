Just wrapped up a fantasy-inspired animated landing page based on **Elden Ring**, and I couldnâ€™t be more excited to share it! ðŸŽ®âœ¨

I wanted to challenge myself creatively and technically, so I blended motion, design, and interactivity to craft something unique:

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack & Features

- âœ… **React.js** â€“ for smooth, component-based structure
- âœ… **Tailwind CSS** â€“ made styling responsive and rapid
- âœ… **GSAP (GreenSock)** â€“ brought animations to life with stunning transitions
- âœ… **SVG Masking** â€“ created a cinematic intro with dynamic text reveals
- âœ… **System Fonts + Remix Icon** â€“ kept things sharp and lightweight
- âœ… **"Moving selfie-style" character intro** â€“ a unique animated entry animation that adds personality on load

## ðŸŽ¨ Creative Focus

Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by how motion can elevate storytelling in a digital experience. This project let me dive deep into that passion. From the **parallax cursor motion** to the **text animation intro**, every detail was carefully coded to deliver an immersive, game-like feel.
